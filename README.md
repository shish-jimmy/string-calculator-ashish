I have created an add function that received strings of numbers and returns number , gives error if numbers are negative and handles all the edge cases and passes all the test cases.

In order to install dependencies please use npm Install command and then in order to run please install ts-node and then run the the file using npm start.

In order run tests please use npm test command.
